# Rooster Grin

Rooster Grin Media test. Deployed and available [here](https://alliecaton.github.io/roostergrin-test/)

Tech At a Glance:

- React Frontend
- Sanity headless CMS backend
- vanilla CSS (including animations)

## Brief Outline of how Requirements and Bonus Features were met :white_check_mark:

TBD

## Technical Deeper Dive :computer:

What technologies I used and why:

- React
  - Quick to get started with create-react-app command
  - Ability to structure components as container parent components with child components works very well for stacked website structures like the one mocked up
  - Eas to reuse components for styling reasons. I created separate button and text container components that are re-used throughout the entire application. This cuts down on a lot of unecessary redundancy.
  - Great for future expanding
- Sanity:
  - etc
- Vanilla CSS:
  - I _love_ creating vanilla CSS animations. When I saw that this application would require animations, I knew right away that I was going to create them using @keyframes with vanilla CSS
  - I enjoy the challenge and versatility of working with vanilla CSS over frameworks like Bootstrap. I also love using Bootstrap, especially when I need to get something up and running quickly, but I like the control that utilizing only CSS gives me.

## Struggles :triumph:

I really wanted to push myself and create this application using almost 100% grid components. I normally rely on flexbox for a lot of my application structuring, so it definitely took a bit of playing around to get all of my grids working how I wanted them to. Grid is super powerful, but definitely more verbose and finicky than flexbox, so my biggest struggles were all centered around my grids responisvely moving where I wanted them to go and keeping all of my elements in the correct spot.

## Favorite Part :sparkles:

CSS animtaions! I love creating CSS animations, and I got to try out some different techniques that I'd never used before on this application. In the past, I'd only ever made color-based CSS animations (gradient cycles, background swipes, etc), so I had a good time making some animations that utilized transform and opacity this time around.

## What I Would Expand Upon :muscle:
